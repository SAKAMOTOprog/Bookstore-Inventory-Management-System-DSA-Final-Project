# Bookstore-Inventory-Management-System-DSA-Final-Project
## Author: Niño Adrian R. Templo
This project is a simple, console-based Bookstore Inventory Management System created for the Data Structures and Algorithms lab. It is written in Java and demonstrates the practical application of fundamental data structures and algorithms, including LinkedLists, Queues, Sorting, and Searching.
## Features

Add New Books: Users can add new books to the inventory by providing a title, author, ISBN, and price.
Dynamic Inventory Storage: Utilizes a `LinkedList` to dynamically store and manage the collection of books.
Display All Books: Shows a complete list of all books currently in the inventory.
Sort Inventory: Implements a Bubble Sort algorithm to organize the books alphabetically by title.
Search for Books: Uses a Linear Search algorithm to find a specific book by its title.
Order Processing: Implements a `Queue` to manage customer book orders in a first-in, first-out (FIFO) manner.
Interactive Menu: A user-friendly, menu-driven interface for easy navigation and operation.
